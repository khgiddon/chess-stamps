Transpositions are included in the player games, because it uses the assigned opening for that particular game, but not for overall games.

TODO:
- Two new categories:
    Random opening you've never played (bounty)
    White/black opening mismatch?
- API error handling (e.g., less than 10 games)
- Upgrade lichess API auth
- Improve UI of entry form
    Own line for button

- "See all data" with full openings data
    Spinning loading piece
    Mouseover for FEN image?
