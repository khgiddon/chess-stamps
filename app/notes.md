Transpositions are included in the player games, because it uses the assigned opening for that particular game, but not for overall games.

TODO:

- API error handling (e.g., less than 10 games)
- Upgrade lichess API auth
- Improve UI of entry form
    Own line for button

- Load "all openings" at same time as main data
- Smooth scroll back up after clicking "Hide all openings"

- Filter by ply, played openings, unplayed openings
