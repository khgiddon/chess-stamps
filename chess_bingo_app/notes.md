Transpositions are included in the player games, because it uses the assigned opening for that particular game, but not for overall games.

TODO:
- Opening diagrams (integrate with some display API)
- Integrate grid with awards
- Add unique stamps / after total unique stamps
- Random opening you've never played (bounty)
- API error handling
