Transpositions are included in the player games, because it uses the assigned opening for that particular game, but not for overall games.

TODO:
- √ Opening diagrams (integrate with some display API)
- √ Integrate grid with awards
- √ Add unique stamps / after total unique stamps
- √ Progress bar
- Random opening you've never played (bounty)
- API error handling (e.g., less than 10 games)
- √ Lichess API auth (temporary single-player solution)
- Put all components in own div with background

- Upgrade lichess API auth


UI:
- Alternate full-length labels with explanatory images on top (AI stamps, etc.)
- Render description below chessboard on mobile?
