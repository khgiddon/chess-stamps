    <b>Q:</b> What are "chess opening stamps"? <br/><br />
    <b>A:</b> Every time you reach a <u>named opening position</u>, you collect a stamp! You can collect multiple stamps in the same game. For example, if you play the Ruy Lopez, you'll collect a stamp for the King's Pawn Game, the King's Knight Opening, the King's Knight Opening: Normal Variation, the Ruy Lopez, and whatever subsequent variation of the Ruy Lopez you end up in.
